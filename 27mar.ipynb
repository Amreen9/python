    "R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a linear regression model. It is also known as the coefficient of determination. R-squared is always between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variability in the dependent variable, and 1 indicates that the model explains all the variability in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate R-squared, we first calculate the total sum of squares (TSS), which is the sum of the squared differences between the actual values of the dependent variable and the mean of the dependent variable. Then, we calculate the residual sum of squares (RSS), which is the sum of the squared differences between the actual values of the dependent variable and the predicted values of the dependent variable. Finally, we calculate R-squared as 1 - (RSS/TSS).\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is a useful measure for evaluating the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. However, it has some limitations. For example, R-squared does not indicate whether the independent variables are statistically significant or whether the model is biased.Therefore, it is important to use other measures, such as the adjusted R-squared, to evaluate the overall quality of the model."

Adjusted R-squared is always lower than R-squared, and it increases only if the new predictor improves the model more than would be expected by chance. It decreases when a predictor improves the model by less than expected by chance.\n",

In other words, adjusted R-squared penalizes the addition of unnecessary predictors to the model, whereas R-squared does not."

    "Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate than R-squared when we have more than one independent variable in the regression model. This is because adjusted R-squared adjusts for the number of predictors in the model, whereas R-squared does not. Adjusted R-squared is a better measure of the goodness of fit of a model when the number of predictors is large, as it accounts for the possibility that some of the predictors may not be statistically significant.\n",

If the R-squared value is 0.8 and the adjusted R-squared value is 0.6, this indicates that some of the predictors in the model are not statistically significant and are not contributing to the model’s explanatory power 3. In this case, we may want to consider removing some of the predictors from the model to improve its overall quality."

    "Regularized linear models are a type of linear regression model that includes a penalty term in the cost function to prevent overfitting.

    "There are two types of regularization techniques: L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge). L1 regularization adds an absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients to the cost function, which results in some coefficients being reduced to zero, effectively removing the corresponding feature from the model. L2 regularization adds the square of the magnitude of the coefficients to the cost function, which shrinks the coefficients towards zero but does not set them to zero.\n",

We want to build a linear regression model to predict the target variable. If we use all 50 features, we may end up with an overfitted model that performs poorly on new data. To prevent overfitting, we can use L1 or L2 regularization to shrink the coefficients towards zero. This will reduce the complexity of the model and prevent it from fitting the noise in the data. By using regularization, we can select only the most important features for our model and improve its overall performance.\n"

    "Regularized linear models are a class of regression models that add a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting. However, they have some limitations that may make them unsuitable for certain regression problems. Here are some of the limitations of regularized linear models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Larger datasets with simple models are better: Regularized linear models are designed to work well with small datasets with many features. However, when the dataset is large and the model is simple, regularized linear models may not be the best choice. In such cases, simpler models like linear regression may perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variable selection using L1 regularization does not replace expert knowledge: Regularized linear models use L1 regularization to perform variable selection. However, this does not replace expert knowledge in selecting the most relevant features for the model. Expert knowledge can help identify features that are important for the model but may not be selected by L1 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No p-values for the regression coefficients: Regularized linear models do not provide p-values for the regression coefficients. This makes it difficult to assess the statistical significance of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Some coefficients are extremely large while others are extremely small, yet non-zero: Regularized linear models can produce coefficients that are extremely large or small, yet non-zero. This can make it difficult to interpret the coefficients and understand their impact on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The coefficient values can be very unstable across cross-validation folds: Regularized linear models can produce unstable coefficient values across different cross-validation folds. This can make it difficult to compare the performance of different models.\n",

However, it is important to carefully consider the limitations of these models before using them for a particular regression problem."
