    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are two methods of transforming categorical variables into numerical values. Label Encoding assigns a unique integer to each category, regardless of the order. Ordinal Encoding assigns integers to categories based on their relative order. Label Encoding can be used for both nominal and ordinal variables, while Ordinal Encoding should only be used for ordinal variables.\n",

If we use Ordinal Encoding instead, we can assign the values 0, 1, and 2 to the categories in ascending order of education level: “High School” = 0, “College” = 1, and “Graduate” = 2."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables for machine learning models. This encoding technique is particularly useful when the target variable is ordinal, meaning that it has a natural order, such as low, medium, and high.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is to replace each category of the categorical variable with a number that represents the mean of the target variable for that category. The categories are then ranked based on their mean target value, and the numbers are assigned in ascending order of the mean target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a dataset with a categorical variable “Education” that has three categories: “High School”, “College”, and “Graduate”. If we use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, we will replace each category with the mean of the target variable (e.g., salary) for that category. Suppose the mean salaries for each category are as follows: “High School” = 30,000, “College” = 50,000, and “Graduate” = 70,000. We would then assign the values 0, 1, and 2 to the categories in ascending order of mean salary: “High School” = 0, “College” = 1, and “Graduate” = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be useful when there is a natural ordering among the categories of a categorical variable and when we want to capture this ordering in our encoding. For example, if we have a dataset with a categorical variable “Experience Level” that has three categories: “Entry-Level”, “Mid-Level”, and “Senior-Level”, we might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to capture the natural ordering of these categories based on their mean salary."

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree to which two variables are linearly associated with each other. It measures the joint variability of two random variables and can take any positive or negative value. A positive covariance means that the two variables tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance means that they move in opposite directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it helps us understand how two variables are related to each other. For example, if we are analyzing a dataset with two variables, X and Y, and we find that they have a high positive covariance, we can conclude that they are positively correlated. This means that as X increases, Y also tends to increase. On the other hand, if we find that X and Y have a high negative covariance, we can conclude that they are negatively correlated. This means that as X increases, Y tends to decrease.\n",
