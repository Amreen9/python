    "- The AUC represents the area under the ROC curve.\n",
    "- It quantifies the overall performance of the binary classification model.\n",
    "- AUC values range from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate better model performance.\n",
    "- Specifically, AUC measures the probability that the model assigns a randomly chosen positive instance a higher predicted probability than a randomly chosen negative instance.\n",
