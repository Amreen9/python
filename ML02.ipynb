    "Overfitting and underfitting are two common problems in machine learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too well, leading to poor generalization performance on new data. On the other hand, underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the training data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data.\n",

If the model performs well on the training data but poorly on the validation data, it may be overfitting.\n",
