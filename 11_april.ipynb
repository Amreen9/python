    "An ensemble technique in machine learning is a method where multiple models, often called “weak learners,” are trained and combined to solve a particular computational intelligence problem. The main principle behind ensemble methods is that a group of weak models can come together to form a strong model, leading to improved prediction performance and robustness compared to any single model alone."

    "Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved Accuracy: Combining predictions from multiple models usually results in better performance than any single model.\n",
    "2. Reduced Overfitting: Ensemble models are less likely to overfit on the training data.\n",
    "3. Increased Robustness: They are more stable and less sensitive to the noise in the training data.\n",
    "4. Handling Different Types of Data: Different models may perform better on different segments of the data, and ensembles can capture this diversity.\n",

    "Overall, ensemble methods leverage the strengths of multiple models to achieve better generalization on unseen data.\n",

    "Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble technique in machine learning where multiple models (usually of the same type) are trained on different subsets of the training dataset. These subsets are created by randomly sampling with replacement from the original dataset, known as bootstrapping. The individual models’ predictions are then aggregated, often by averaging or majority voting, to form the final prediction. Bagging helps in reducing variance and avoiding overfitting."

    "Boosting is an ensemble technique in machine learning that aims to create a strong classifier from a number of weak classifiers. This is achieved by training the weak classifiers sequentially, each trying to correct the errors of its predecessor. The final model is made by combining these weak classifiers, typically with a weighted sum or majority vote. Boosting helps in reducing bias and variance and is particularly effective for improving the performance of models on imbalanced datasets."
