Since most Machine Learning languages only understand numerical data, preprocessing the categorical data becomes a very necessary step.we need to convert these categorical variables into numbers so that the model is able to understand and extract the valuable information, there are many types of categorical data encoding such as binary encoding, one-hot encoding, label encoding and many more. each method have their own advantages and disadvantages such as binary encoding is useful when there is many categorical variables and one-hot encoding is useful when there is less categorical features."

You would create a new column for each country, and if a customer is from that country, you would assign a value of 1 in that column, and 0 otherwise.

It is used when there is no inherent order or hierarchy between the categories. One practical example of nominal encoding is when we have a dataset with a categorical variable like “color” that has no natural ordering between its categories (e.g., red, blue, green, etc.). In this case, nominal encoding can be used to assign a unique integer value to each color category.\n",

    "To transform categorical data with 5 unique values into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms, we can use binary encoding. Binary encoding is a technique that converts each unique category value into a binary number. Each binary digit represents a power of 2, with the least significant bit on the right and the most significant bit on the left. The number of digits required to represent the unique values is equal to the base-2 logarithm of the number of unique values. In this case, we have 5 unique values, so we need 3 digits to represent them in binary.\n",

    "Binary encoding is a good choice for this scenario because it is more efficient than one-hot encoding, which creates a new column for each unique value and assigns a 1 or 0 to indicate whether that value is present in the original column. Binary encoding requires fewer columns and can reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, which can be beneficial for machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.\n"
